## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice

This version of `ox_inventory` has been modified to ensure **broad framework compatibility**, now working seamlessly with **qb-core**, **qbox**, **esx**, **ox_core**, and **nd_core**.

It began as a continuation of an older fork that reintroduced QB support but is no longer available. Since then, this fork has grown into a **community-focused project** that prioritizes compatibility while introducing small, non-intrusive quality-of-life improvements.

**Important:**
The original `ox_inventory` was created by the **Overextended** team and remains under its original license. It is **no longer actively maintained** by them, and this fork is **not officially supported** by Overextended.
Please do **not contact them** for issues related to this version.

---

### Purpose

The goal of this fork is to provide a **collaborative, framework-inclusive solution** for the FiveM community. We believe in open-source software that adapts with community input, encouraging innovation and evolution through collective development.

---

## Key Differences from Other Forks

### Framework Compatibility

* Full support for **qb-core** (latest versions).
* Preserves complete functionality for **esx**, **ox_core**, **qbox**, and **nd_core**.
* No framework-specific features are lost ‚Äî everything continues to work across supported frameworks.

---

### Rarity Indicators (Optional Visual Feature)

![Rarity System Demo](rarity.gif)

* Items can now display a **star icon** in the bottom-left corner based on a `"rarity"` metadata key.
* **Color-Based Rarities**: `common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, `epic`, `legendary`, `artifact`, `red`, `pink`, `gold`, `rainbow`, `silver`, `bronze`, `copper`, `blue`, `green`, `cyan`, `magenta`, `yellow`, `orange`, `purple`, `lime`, `teal`, `indigo`, `violet`, `maroon`, `navy`, `olive`, `aqua`, `fuchsia`, `black`, `white`, `crimson`, `turquoise`, `lavender`, `rose`
* The `rainbow` rarity features a special animated color-cycling effect.
* **Default Rarity Support**: define rarities directly in `data/items.lua` or `data/weapons.lua` for automatic application.
* Can also be overridden at runtime when adding items.

#### Usage Examples:
```lua
-- In data/items.lua
['rare_gem'] = {
    label = 'Rare Gem',
    weight = 50,
    rarity = 'rare',  -- Will automatically show blue star
}

-- In data/weapons.lua (inside Weapons table)
['WEAPON_LEGENDARY_PISTOL'] = {
    label = 'Legendary Pistol',
    weight = 1200,
    durability = 0.2,
    ammoname = 'ammo-9',
    rarity = 'legendary',  -- Will automatically show orange star
}

-- Runtime metadata override
exports.ox_inventory:AddItem(playerId, 'item_name', 1, {
    rarity = 'epic'  -- Overrides default rarity or sets one
})
```

### Additional Enhancements

* **Extra image formats** supported: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`.
* **More hosting sources allowed**, including **img.bb** and **Discord CDN**.

These additions simplify image use for icons and embedded content without extra setup.
